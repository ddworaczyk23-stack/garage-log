# Active Handoff

Shared state between Claude Code and Codex on this repo. Read this before
starting work; update it when you finish.

**Hard rule: this file holds OPEN work only.** The moment a task is
confirmed done (live-verified, deployed, or explicitly dropped), delete its
entry — don't leave a "RESOLVED"/"DONE" paragraph sitting here. Before
deleting, fold anything future-you would need into the right place: a durable
rule goes in `CLAUDE.md`, and the story goes in git history / a changelog if
this project keeps one. This file is not the permanent record. Prune
aggressively, every time.

## Open

- **Saved problems everywhere + one shop brief.** Plan:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-14-concerns-and-brief.md` (from the
  2026-10-14 15:42 design review, 28/40). Codex builds on
  `fix/concerns-and-brief`, one PR, do not merge. Claude reviews.

- **Possible follow-up (not started, user chose calendar for now):** true
  push + email reminders need a server (e.g. Cloudflare Worker cron + Web Push
  for home-screen PWAs on iOS 16.4+, Resend for email). Means due dates leave
  the device, so confirm with the user before building.
